##Renaming
# Rename all columns to snake case
nhanes_small <- rename_with(nhanes_small, snakecase::to_snake_case)

nhanes_small

#Renaming specific columns
rename(nhanes_small, sex = gender)

#Putting it into the dataset so it is saved in the new dataset
nhanes_small <- rename(nhanes_small, sex = gender)

## The pipe operator

#without the pipe operator
colnames(nhanes_small)

# Pipe operator: Ctrl+Shift+M
nhanes_small %>% colnames()

#Using the pipe operator with more functions
nhanes_small %>%

## Filtering
# filter for all females
nhanes_small %>%
    filter(sex == "female")

# Participants who are not female
nhanes_small %>%
    filter(sex != "female")

# Participants who have BMI equal to 25
nhanes_small %>%
    filter(bmi == 25)

# Participants who have BMI greater than or equal to 25
nhanes_small %>%
    filter(bmi >= 25)

# BMI is greater than 25 AND sex is female
nhanes_small %>%
    filter(bmi > 25 & sex == "female")

# BMI is grater than 25 or sex is female. fn+alt+ Â´for |
nhanes_small %>%
    filter(bmi > 25 | sex == "female")

##Arranging data
# Arranging by age in ascending order
nhanes_small %>%
    arrange(age)

#Arrange by sex in ascending order
nhanes_small %>%
    arrange(sex)

#Arranging by age in descending order
nhanes_small %>%
    arrange(desc(age))

#Arranging by sex then age in ascending order
nhanes_small %>%
    arrange(sex, age)

##Arranging by sex then age in descending order
nhanes_small %>%
    arrange(desc(sex), age)

##Transform or add columns.
#Height in meter instead of cm
nhanes_small %>%
    mutate(height = height/100)

#Add a new column with logged height values
nhanes_small %>%
    mutate(logged_height = log(height))

# Transform height values to metres and add log column in one step.
nhanes_small %>%
    mutate(height = height / 100,
           logged_height = log(height))

#New column based on how active participants are
nhanes_small %>%
    mutate(highly_active = if_else(phys_active_days >= 5, "yes", "No"))


nhanes_update <- nhanes_small %>%
    mutate(height = height/100,

           hightly_active = if_else(phys_active_days >= 5, "yes", "No"))

##Summary statistics by group. na.rm means remove NA.
nhanes_small %>%
    summarise(max_bmi = max(bmi))

    summarise(max_bmi = max(bmi, na.rm = TRUE))

#Find out how many missing values (NAs) are there?

nhanes_small %>%
    summarise(max_bmi = max(bmi, na.rm = TRUE),

##Calculating summary statistics by group
nhanes_small %>%
    group_by(diabetes) %>%
    summarise (mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
               mean_bmi = mean(bmi, na.rm = TRUE))

#Filtering the NAs aways by using filter.
nhanes_small %>%
    filter(!is.na(diabetes)) %>%
    group_by(diabetes) %>%
    summarise (mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
